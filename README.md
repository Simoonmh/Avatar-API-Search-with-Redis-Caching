# Avatar API Search with Redis Caching
A web application that harnesses a public API for Avatar: The Last Airbender characters and nations. 
It features a character search functionality and optimizes performance with a Redis caching system deployed using Docker. 

-mainSearch.py is the main code for the system and uses Redis to manage cache.  
-search_noCache.py was used to measure search time without Redis caching.
